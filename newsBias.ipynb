    "# News Bias analysis notebook\n",
    "#### Authors: Alexander Lambert, Casey Mathews, and Shivam Patel\n",
    "#### Githubs: alambe22, cmathew9, and spatel90\n",
    "## Description: \n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to analysze a given set of articles (found in datasets/articles.txt) with known biases and leanings to see if patterns can be determined in their writing. \n",
    "We analyze the following parts of the articles:\n",
    "- Buzzwords and phrases count\n",
    "- Emotional word count\n",
    "- Average word length\n",
    "- Use of words with negative connotations\n",
    "- Use of words with positive connotations\n",
    "- Use of words that indicate opinion (I think, I believe, etc.)\n",
    "- Use of words that indicate fact (We know, research indicates, etc)\n",
    "- First person pronoun usage (Does the author present this as their perspective, or as information)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data we gather, the hope is to find patterns that could be used to analyze new articles for bias or factuality.\n",
